# SmileySocksWebsite
Website concept I made for Smiley Socks.

The code for this website can be used for any project of yours with my full consent. It uses an animation plugin called aos for the scroll animation.
However I didn't use it on the base website to save you the trouble of unediting the animation out of the code.
